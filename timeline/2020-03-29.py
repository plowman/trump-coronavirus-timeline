  title="Trump accuses hospitals of stealing masks",
  description="""
  Trump said it doesn't make sense that a hospital would suddenly need way more masks. Instead of learning why you need
  more masks to treat covid patients, he instead amplified a conspiracy theory that the hospitals have been stealing 
  them.

  The quote:
  > Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the
  > back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places.
