  Here is the full question:
  > Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was in fact a failing do you 
  take responsibility for that? And when can you guarantee that every single American who needs a test will be able to 
  have a test what's the date of that?
  
  And his response was:
  > Yeah no I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a a set of circumstances and we were given rules 
  regulations and specifications from a different time. [... long meandering nonsense]
  
  It will not surprise you to learn that there was no mythical Obama regulations that slowed anyone down.
