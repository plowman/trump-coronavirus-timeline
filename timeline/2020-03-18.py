  description="""
  The White House renewed its nomination of Brett Giroir to the WHO Executive Board, which has been without a US 
  representative since Trump took office. Of the 34 member states on the Executive Board, the US seat is the only empty 
  one.
  
  Why it matters: Despite complaining of the WHO shortcomings, Trump has not done even the bare minimum to better 
  utilize the WHO as a resource.
