#### Trump fires official in charge of Pandemic response, Timothy Ziemer
Trump removed Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council. Ziemer was the Senior Director for Global Health 
  Security and Biothreats. His responsibilities included preparedness against infectious diseases, including leading the
  response in case of a pandemic.
  
  Ziemer's departure follows the earlier departure of homeland security Tom Bossert. Neither Ziemer nor Bossert were 
  ever replaced.

#### Trump ends Coronavirus early detection program
The project, launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2009, identified 1,200 different 
  viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, including more than 160 novel coronaviruses. The initiative, 
  called PREDICT, also trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories — including the Wuhan lab that identified 
  SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

#### US intelligence agencies begin warning about coronavirus
U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger 
  posed by the coronavirus while President Trump and lawmakers played down the threat and failed to take action that 
  might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting.

#### Trump's first comments on Coronavirus: 'we have it totally under control. ... It’s going to be just fine.'
President Trump made his first public comments about the coronavirus in a TV interview from Davos with CNBC’s Joe 
  Kernen. The first American case had been announced the day before, and Kernen asked Trump, “Are there worries about a 
  pandemic at this point?”

  Trump said, “No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have 
  it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”

#### Navarro sends memo warning 543,000 Americans could die
Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro circulated in the White House warning that there would be a dire human and 
  economic costs. He specifically warns that an outbreak in the US could cost the economy up to $5.7 Trillion and as 
  many as 543,000 people could die.

  It is unclear whether the president ever read this memo.

#### Trump proposes 16 percent cut to CDC
The Trump budget this year included a 16 percent cut to the CDC. It appears his budget tries to cut the CDC budget 
  basically every year. That he would still attempt to do so during the early signs of a pandemic is insane.

  out fine.”

#### Navarro sends second dire memo, warns 1-2 Million could die, warns of PPE and ventilator needs
Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro circulated a second memo, this time to officials throughout the NSC.
  
  Specifically it warned:
  * 1-2 million people could die
  * 100 million people could catch the virus
  * We would need over a billion face masks, 200,000 Tyvek suits, 11,000 ventilator circuits, 25,000 powered 
  air-purifying respirators (PAPR's).
  
  It then asked for $3 Billion to support efforts at prevention, treatment, inoculation and diagnostics.

### Feb 24, 2020
#### Trump says coronavirus 'very much under control', stock market is 'starting to look very good to me.'
A day after Navarro warned 1-2 million people in the US could die, Trump tweeted his regular dose of nonsense.

### Feb 25, 2020
#### CDC official warns public about coronavirus and Trump complained it was scaring the stock market
On Feb. 25, Nancy Messonnier, a senior CDC official, sounded perhaps the most significant public alarm to that point, 
  when she told reporters that the coronavirus was likely to spread within communities in the United States and that 
  disruptions to daily life could be “severe.” Trump called Azar on his way back from a trip to India and complained 
  that Messonnier was scaring the stock markets, according to two senior administration officials.

#### Dr. Helen Chu defies government order to test for the coronavirus and discovers it's already in the US
Dr. Chu and her colleagues had been gathering nasal swabs from people in the Seattle area experiencing flu symptoms.
  She sought permission from the government and was rejected multiple times.
  
  Finally, they started testing anyway and soon discovered a teen with no recent travel history who had coronavirus.
  
  If the federal government had granted her earlier permission, we could have known much sooner about community spread
  in the US.

Trump said: "It's going to disappear. One day -- it's like a miracle -- it will disappear. And from our shores, we 
  -- you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We'll see what happens. Nobody really 
  knows. The fact is, the greatest experts -- I've spoken to them all. Nobody really knows."

#### Trump says "Democrats are politicizing the Coronavirus", says, "this is their new hoax".
A lot of Trumpkins are debating this quote now, but he clearly says the coronavirus is "their new hoax" in the same way
that impeachment was a hoax.

The full Trump quote is this:

"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that coronavirus? They're politicizing it. 

We did one of the great jobs. You say, "How's president Trump doing?" They go, "oh not good not good."

They have no truth they don't have any clue they can't even count their votes in Iowa they can't even they can't count 
their votes.

One of my people came up to me and said Mr. President they tried to beat you on Russia Russia Russia that didn't work 
out too well they couldn't do it they tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation they tried anything 
they tried it over and over they've been doing it since you got in it's all turning they lost it's all turning think of
it think of it and *this is their new hoax.*

But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing we're 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact
that we went early we went early we could have had a lot more than that."

#### Trump blames covid outbreak on 'Democrat policy of open borders'.
Also at the South Carolina rally, Trump said "The Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and
  well-being of all Americans. Now you see it with the coronavirus, you see it. You see it with the coronavirus."

#### Trump adds Jared Kushner to the Coronavirus response team
From the attached article, "Kushner was initially tapped to join the coronavirus response by Trump on March 12, when
  he moved quickly to address the testing shortfalls and pulled in allies with a track record of launching health care 
  companies."

#### For ventilators, Trump tells governors 'Try getting it yourselves'
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” he said, adding “We will be backing you,
  but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.”

  This is bad because it forces states to bid against one another on ventilators rather than creating a system where 
  there is a single buyer. This is also bad because it does not inspire any confidence that there is a national plan for
  actually getting states the equipment they need.

#### Trump again pushes Hydroxychloroquine, saying 'What do you have to lose?'
“If it does work, it would be a shame we did not do it early,” Mr. Trump said, noting the federal government had 
  purchased and stockpiled 29 million pills of the drug. “We are sending them to various labs, our military, we’re 
  sending them to the hospitals.”

  “There are side effects to hydroxychloroquine,” Dr. Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University. “It causes 
  psychiatric symptoms, cardiac problems and a host of other bad side effects.”
  
  Why it's bad: this is a pretty serious drug with serious side effects. It's unbelievably irresponsible to tell people
  to just take it and not worry about it.

#### Trump removes inspector general who would oversee $2 trillion stimulus spending
Trump removed Glenn Fine, the chairman of the federal panel Congress created to oversee his administration’s 
  management of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.
  
  To explain his move, Trump said, “We have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era,” he said Tuesday. “And as you know, it’s
  a presidential decision. And I left them, largely. I mean, changed some, but I left them. . . . But when we have, you 
  know, reports of bias and when we have different things coming in. I don’t know Fine. I don’t think I ever met Fine.”

#### Trump threatens to stop funding the WHO
"We’re going to put a hold on money spent to the W.H.O. We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it and we’re going 
  to see," Trump said during the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House. He added, "They called it wrong. They 
  call it wrong. They really, they missed the call."
  
  The claim that "they missed the call" is obviously a lie. The WHO declared a “public health emergency of international
  concern” weeks before Mr. Trump declared a national emergency.
