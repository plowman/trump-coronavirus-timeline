### Robert Redfield, who has never worked in government, becomes CDC director
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  How hard could it be, right? Seriously though, in his defense, he has done some great public health work on AIDS. 
  
  However, it's hard not to wonder if someone with experience in government could have done better. For example, the 5
  previous CDC directors all had experience in government.

### Trump discontinues CDC expert job in China
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  The post was held by Dr. Linda Quick. Her job was to train Chinese epidemiologists to help track, investigate, and 
  contain diseases.

  From the article,
  > “It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by
    the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health
    officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”
  
  Why it matters: If it's true that China knew earlier than anyone else, having CDC experts on the ground in China could
  have helped us realize the severity of the outbreak sooner.

  The project, launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2009, identified 1,200 different 
  viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, including more than 160 novel coronaviruses. The initiative, 
  called PREDICT, also trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories — including the Wuhan lab that identified 
  SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

### China travel ban begins, does not change entry for US citizens
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  The travel ban prevents travel to the US if you've been to mainland China in the past 14 days. However, the ban does 
  not apply to US citizens and their families. As a result, 40,000 people have traveled from China to the US from when 
  the ban began until April 4th.
  
  For those 40,000 there was little to no actual preventive measures. As far as I can tell, nobody was tested for covid 
  and nobody was required to quarantine. Occasionally your temperature would be taken at an airport, and usually you 
  would be asked to stay home for 14 days.
  
  From the New York Times article:
  > Re-entry to the US during this time is very lax. A traveler from Beijing going to Seattle was asked if he had a
    temperature and whether he had been to Wuhan. They gave him a card requesting he stay home for two weeks. Nobody 
    ever followed up.

  their home. It wasn't until April that we confirmed coronavirus was to blame.

  From the article,
  > The county’s medical examiner-coroner said that autopsies of two people who died at their homes on Feb. 6 and 
  Feb. 17 showed that the individuals were infected with the virus.
  
  Why it matters: if we had spun up testing sooner or started doing better tracking of Americans returning from China,
  we could have known this was happening so much sooner.

"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that coronavirus? They're politicizing it. 

We did one of the great jobs. You say, "How's president Trump doing?" They go, "oh not good not good."

They have no truth they don't have any clue they can't even count their votes in Iowa they can't even they can't count 
their votes.

One of my people came up to me and said Mr. President they tried to beat you on Russia Russia Russia that didn't work

they tried it over and over they've been doing it since you got in it's all turning they lost it's all turning think of

  rather have 3,533 passengers, mostly Americans, suffer and get infected at sea than have his case count increase. 103 
  passengers eventually tested positive and at least 3 died.

<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  He terrified Americans traveling in Europe and tanked the markets by falsely stating that all goods and people would 
  be banned starting on March 13th at midnight.
  
  The first problematic quote was this:
  > To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for 
  the next 30 days.
  
  In reality, Americans were still allowed to return to the US. Claiming that "all travel" was being suspended caused
  Americans abroad to start panic buying expensive flights home because they were afraid they would get stuck in Europe.

  The second problematic quote was this:
  > "[...] these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things 
  as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing."
  
  In reality, the prohibitions did not apply to cargo.

  have a test what's the date of that?
  
  And his response was:
  > Yeah no I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a a set of circumstances and we were given rules 
  regulations and specifications from a different time. [... long meandering nonsense]
  
  It will not surprise you to learn that there was no mythical Obama regulations that slowed anyone down.

### Trump tries to blame Obama for testing problems
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  Tacitly admitting that there were testing problems, which is a small victory for reality, Trump then tried to shift
  the blame to his favorite scapegoat, Obama.
  
  His full tweet was:
  > For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied,  its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be 
  inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made 
  changes that only complicated things further.....
  .... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to 
  fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale 
  basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!
  
  It's true that the CDC under Obama did propose increased oversight of medical testing, but it was just a proposal that
  was never implemented. 
  
  Even if Trump had inherited a CDC that was not prepared, he is in charge of it and can thus direct it to change as he
  sees fit. The problem is that he didn't move more quickly.

  “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” he said, adding “We will be backing you,

  This is bad because it forces states to bid against one another on ventilators rather than creating a system where 
  there is a single buyer. This is also bad because it does not inspire any confidence that there is a national plan for
  actually getting states the equipment they need.

  say, “Oh gee, we should get this, we should get that.” We’re doing a great job, like in New York, where we’re

  according to current and former American officials.
  
  Why it matters: Having messed up the response, Trump is now searching as hard as he can for a scapegoat. Blaming China
  for literally manufacturing the virus is too juicy for Trump to resist.

### Trump replacing HHS watchdog because she identified critical medical shortages
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  Trump nominated a replacement for Health and Human Services inspector general Christi Grimm. Grimm published a report 
  on April 3rd where she surveyed 323 hospitals and asked what their biggest challenges were responding to the pandemic.
  Among the hospitals' concerns were severe shortages of testing supplies and long waits for results.
  
  Trump found out about the report on April 6th, when he had this exchange with a reporter:
  > Reporter: Despite the nearly 1.8 million tests that you say the United States has done, the Inspector General for 
  the Department of Health and Human Services released a report today — a survey — of more than 300 hospitals across the 
  country.  And the number one complaint from those hospitals were severe shortages of testing supplies and a really 
  long wait time.
  
  > THE PRESIDENT:  It’s just wrong.  Did I hear the word “inspector general”?  Really?  It’s wrong.  And they’ll talk 
  to you about it.  It’s wrong.
  
  > Reporter: But this is your own government.
  
  > THE PRESIDENT:  Uh, it’s — well, where did he come from — the inspector general?  What’s his name?
  
  Why it matters: Trump doesn't care about fixing the problems. He only cares about silencing the criticism.

### Former HHS official says Trump pushed him to award contracts to cronies
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  Rick Bright, who was recently fired for his anti-hydroxychloroquine stance, is back, claiming he was pressured to 
  award contracts to Trump cronies during his tenure at the HHS.

  From the article:
  > Rick Bright, the ousted chief of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency, said he was pressured to 
  steer millions of dollars to the clients of a well-connected consultant.
  
  Why it matters: When we award contracts to connected companies instead of the best companies, it makes our response 
  to this kind of crisis worse.

### Trump has begun questioning accuracy of death count in private
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  From the article:
  > President Trump has complained to advisers about the way coronavirus deaths are being calculated, suggesting the 
  real numbers are actually lower — and a number of his senior aides share this view, according to sources with direct 
  knowledge.
  
  Why it matters: The only way not to look bad at this point, Trump thinks, is if the dead people... maybe aren't dead?

### Trump blocks CDC reopening guidance over fears it will harm the economy
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  From the article:
  > White House and other administration officials rejected the recommendations over concerns that they were overly 
  prescriptive, infringed on religious rights and risked further damaging an economy that Mr. Trump was banking on to 
  recover quickly.
  
  Why it matters: It's nice that Trump went through this long process of formally rejecting expert health advice just to
  remind us that he doesn't give a shit.

### Trump valet tests positive for coronavirus
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

  In the continued comedy of errors that is Trump failing to take this seriously until it affects him personally, one of
  the military personal in daily close contact with Trump has tested positive for coronavirus. From the article, "The 
  infected staffer is one of Trump’s personal valets, the military staff members who sometimes serve meals and look 
  after personal needs of the president."
  
  In response he has increased testing from once per week to once per day. 
  
  Why it matters: Trump is not going to take this seriously until he gets it personally, so I guess that's one way this
  could end up being a good thing.

  the task force is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding down. It is appreciated by the 
  public.”
