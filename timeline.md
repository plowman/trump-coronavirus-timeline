Trump removed Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council. Ziemer was the Senior Director for Global Health 
  Security and Biothreats. His responsibilities included preparedness against infectious diseases, including leading the
  response in case of a pandemic. He was never replaced.

### Trump discontinues CDC expert job in China
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

The post was held by Dr. Linda Quick. Her job was to train Chinese epidemiologists to help track, investigate, and 
  contain diseases.

  From the article,
  > “It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by
    the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health
    officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”
  
  Why it matters: If it's true that China knew earlier than anyone else, having CDC experts on the ground in China could
  have helped us realize the severity of the outbreak sooner.

The project, launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development in 2009, identified 1,200 different 
  viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, including more than 160 novel coronaviruses. The initiative, 
  called PREDICT, also trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories — including the Wuhan lab that identified 
  SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger

  might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting.

President Trump made his first public comments about the coronavirus in a TV interview from Davos with CNBC’s Joe 
  Kernen. The first American case had been announced the day before, and Kernen asked Trump, “Are there worries about a 
  pandemic at this point?”

  Trump said, “No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have 
  it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”

Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro circulated in the White House warning that there would be a dire human and 
  economic costs. He specifically warns that an outbreak in the US could cost the economy up to $5.7 Trillion and as 
  many as 543,000 people could die.

  It is unclear whether the president ever read this memo.

### China travel ban begins, does not change entry for US citizens
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

The travel ban prevents travel to the US if you've been to mainland China in the past 14 days. However, the ban does 
  not apply to US citizens and their families. As a result, 40,000 people have traveled from China to the US from when 
  the ban began until April 4th.
  
  For those 40,000 there was little to no actual preventive measures. As far as I can tell, nobody was tested for covid 
  and nobody was required to quarantine. Occasionally your temperature would be taken at an airport, and usually you 
  would be asked to stay home for 14 days.
  
  From the New York Times article:
  > Re-entry to the US during this time is very lax. A traveler from Beijing going to Seattle was asked if he had a
    temperature and whether he had been to Wuhan. They gave him a card requesting he stay home for two weeks. Nobody 
    ever followed up.

Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro circulated a second memo, this time to officials throughout the NSC.
  
  Specifically it warned:
  * 1-2 million people could die
  * 100 million people could catch the virus
  * We would need over a billion face masks, 200,000 Tyvek suits, 11,000 ventilator circuits, 25,000 powered

On Feb. 25, Nancy Messonnier, a senior CDC official, sounded perhaps the most significant public alarm to that point, 
  when she told reporters that the coronavirus was likely to spread within communities in the United States and that 
  disruptions to daily life could be “severe.” Trump called Azar on his way back from a trip to India and complained 
  that Messonnier was scaring the stock markets, according to two senior administration officials.

Dr. Chu and her colleagues had been gathering nasal swabs from people in the Seattle area experiencing flu symptoms.
  She sought permission from the government and was rejected multiple times.
  
  Finally, they started testing anyway and soon discovered a teen with no recent travel history who had coronavirus.
  
  If the federal government had granted her earlier permission, we could have known much sooner about community spread
  in the US.

<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

A lot of Trumpkins are debating this quote now, but he clearly says the coronavirus is "their new hoax" in the same way
that impeachment was a hoax.

The full Trump quote is this:

"Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that coronavirus? They're politicizing it. 

We did one of the great jobs. You say, "How's president Trump doing?" They go, "oh not good not good."

They have no truth they don't have any clue they can't even count their votes in Iowa they can't even they can't count 
their votes.

One of my people came up to me and said Mr. President they tried to beat you on Russia Russia Russia that didn't work 
out too well they couldn't do it they tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation they tried anything 
they tried it over and over they've been doing it since you got in it's all turning they lost it's all turning think of
it think of it and *this is their new hoax.*

But you know we did something that's been pretty amazing we're 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact
that we went early we went early we could have had a lot more than that."

His full quote is this:
  > “They would like to have the people come off,” he said. “I would like to have the people stay. I told them to make 
    the final decision. I would rather — because I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the 
    numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault. And it wasn’t the fault of the people on the ship either. 
    OK? It wasn’t their fault, either. And they are mostly Americans.”
  
  Why it matters: Trump is saying the health of humans is less important than how good he thinks he looks. He would 
  rather have 3,533 passengers, mostly Americans, suffer and get infected at sea than have his case count increase. 103 
  passengers eventually tested positive and at least 3 died.

“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” he said, adding “We will be backing you,

  This is bad because it forces states to bid against one another on ventilators rather than creating a system where 
  there is a single buyer. This is also bad because it does not inspire any confidence that there is a national plan for
  actually getting states the equipment they need.

  The Trump quote is this:

  say, “Oh gee, we should get this, we should get that.” We’re doing a great job, like in New York, where we’re

  “There are side effects to hydroxychloroquine,” Dr. Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University. “It causes 
  psychiatric symptoms, cardiac problems and a host of other bad side effects.”
  
  Why it's bad: this is a pretty serious drug with serious side effects. It's unbelievably irresponsible to tell people
  to just take it and not worry about it.

### FEMA is seizing coronavirus supplies ordered by hospitals and states
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

Despite directing states and hospitals to get their own supplies however they can, the federal government has at the
  same time been seizing the medical supplies that states have ordered.
  
  Multiple governors and hospitals in multiple states are reporting that FEMA has commandeered shipments of masks, 
  ventilators, thermometers, and other medical equipment that had been ordered by various states and hospitals.
  
  It is not at all clear how this equipment is then being routed to various states.

### Trump removes inspector general who would oversee $2 trillion stimulus spending
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

Trump removed Glenn Fine, the chairman of the federal panel Congress created to oversee his administration’s 
  management of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.
  
  To explain his move, Trump said, “We have a lot of IGs in from the Obama era,” he said Tuesday. “And as you know, it’s
  a presidential decision. And I left them, largely. I mean, changed some, but I left them. . . . But when we have, you 
  know, reports of bias and when we have different things coming in. I don’t know Fine. I don’t think I ever met Fine.”

### Trump threatens to stop funding the WHO

"We’re going to put a hold on money spent to the W.H.O. We’re going to put a very powerful hold on it and we’re going 
  to see," Trump said during the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House. He added, "They called it wrong. They 
  call it wrong. They really, they missed the call."
  
  The claim that "they missed the call" is obviously a lie. The WHO declared a “public health emergency of international
  concern” weeks before Mr. Trump declared a national emergency.

### Trump delays stimulus checks so that his name can appear on them
<details>
  <summary>...</summary>

Trump has ordered the Treasury department to tell the IRS that his name should appear on the stimulus checks being 
  sent out to Americans. Not only is this not normal, it may actually slow down delivery of the checks by a few days. 

  From the article,
  > The Treasury Department has ordered President Trump’s name be printed on stimulus checks the Internal Revenue 
    Service is rushing to send to tens of millions of Americans, a process that could slow their delivery by a few days,
    senior IRS officials said.
  
  Why it matters: Trump shows that his own vanity is more important than actually getting people the help they need.
