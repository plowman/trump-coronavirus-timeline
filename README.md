# Trump Covid / Coronavirus Response Timeline
A history of Trump's mismanagement of the COVID-19 response


## Where is the timeline?
[Here is the latest Trump Coronavirus Timeline](https://github.com/plowman/trump-coronavirus-timeline/blob/master/timeline.md).


## What is this?
This is a project to create a crowd-sourced history of all the dumb stuff Trump has done to botch our preparation and
response to covid. We can't control all the dumb shit Trump does, so maybe writing it down will make us feel less crazy.


## How to contribute
- Have you written at least a little code before? [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/plowman/trump-coronavirus-timeline/compare) with the event you want to add.
- Are you less technical? [Create an Issue](https://github.com/plowman/trump-coronavirus-timeline/issues/new) with what you 
think is missing.


## Events we care about
At a high level, what we care about is anything Trump has done since he was elected that has made this pandemic worse
than it would have otherwise been.

More specifically, this includes:
- Dismantling existing preparations
- Weakening institutions tasked to respond
- Failing to prepare
- Downplaying the emerging threat
- Failing to respond properly
- Responding in ways that made things worse
- Blaming others
- Focusing on himself instead of the country
